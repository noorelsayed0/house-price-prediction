This project demonstrates a simple regression model built using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict house prices based on various property features such as:

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

Square footage

Other numerical features

The goal is to predict housing prices accurately using real-world structured data and apply key machine learning and deep learning techniques.
